# Issue Summary:
On May 10th, 2023, at 3:30 PM EST, our application experienced an outage that lasted for 2 hours. The outage was caused by the failure of a third-party library that had been phased out, leading to a disruption of critical application functionality. The outage affected all users, resulting in a 100% impact on our services.

# Timeline:

3:30 PM EST: The issue was first detected by a user who reported that they were unable to access a critical feature of our application.
3:35 PM EST: The incident was escalated to the engineering team, who immediately began investigating the issue.
3:40 PM EST: Initial investigation showed that the issue was caused by a third-party library that was no longer supported.
4:00 PM EST: The engineering team attempted to restore functionality by rolling back to an earlier version of the library, but this did not resolve the issue.
4:30 PM EST: Further investigation revealed that the library had been deprecated and phased out by the vendor, causing compatibility issues with our application.
5:30 PM EST: The engineering team reached out to the vendor for support and received a recommendation to upgrade to a newer library version that was compatible with our application.
6:30 PM EST: After updating the library, the application functionality was restored, and the outage was resolved.
Root cause and resolution:
The root cause of the outage was the use of a third-party library that had been deprecated and phased out by the vendor. This caused compatibility issues with our application, resulting in the outage. The issue was resolved by upgrading to a newer library version that was compatible with our application.

# Corrective and preventative measures:
To prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, the following corrective and preventative measures will be implemented:

Regular audits of third-party libraries to ensure that they are up-to-date and supported by vendors.
Implementation of a process for timely identification and replacement of deprecated libraries.
Review of vendor support and maintenance policies before the selection of any new third-party libraries.
Implementation of a robust monitoring system to detect issues early and prevent outages.

# Tasks to address the issue:
Update all existing third-party libraries to their latest versions to ensure they are up-to-date and supported.
Develop a process to monitor library support status and proactively replace deprecated libraries.
Conduct a review of vendor support and maintenance policies before selecting any new third-party libraries.
Implement a robust monitoring system to detect issues early and prevent outages.
In conclusion, the outage was caused by the use of a third-party library that had been deprecated and phased out by the vendor. While the issue was ultimately resolved by upgrading to a newer version of the library, steps will be taken to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future through the implementation of corrective and preventative measures.
